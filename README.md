This is a ruby implementation of a fast simple feed commonly used in a typical social network-like applications. The implementation is optimized for **read-time performance** and high concurrency (lots of users). A default Redis-based provider implementation is provided, with the API supporting new providers very easily.

## What's an Activity Feed?

Here is an example of a text-based simple feed that is very common today on social networking sites.

[![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kigster/simple-feed/master/man/sf-example.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kigster/simple-feed/master/man/sf-example.png)

The _stories_ in the feed depend entirely on the application using this
library, therefore to integrate with SimpleFeed requires implementing
several _glue points_ in your code.

## Overview

 The feed library aims to address the following goals:

* To define a minimalistic API for a typical event-based simple feed,
  without tying it to any concrete provider implementation
* To make it easy to implement and plug in a new type of provider,
  eg.using Couchbase or MongoDB
* To provide a scalable default provider implementation using Redis, which can support millions of users via sharding
* To support multiple simple feeds within the same application, but used for different purposes, eg. simple feed of my followers, versus simple feed of my own actions.

## Usage

First you need to configure the Feed with a valid provider
implementation and a name.

### Configuration

Below we configure a feed called `:news_feed`, which presumably
will be populated with the events coming from the followers.

```ruby
require 'simplefeed'
require 'simplefeed/redis/provider'
require 'yaml'

# Let's configure backend provider via a Hash, although we can also
# instantiate it directly (as shown in the second example below)
provider_yaml = <<-eof
  klass: SimpleFeed::Providers::Redis::Provider
  opts:
    host: '127.0.0.1'
    port: 6379
    namespace: :fa
    db: 1
eof

SimpleFeed.define(:news_feed) do |f|
  f.provider = YAML.load(provider_yaml)
  f.max_size = 1000 # how many items can be in the feed
  f.per_page = 20 # default page size
end

# Now let's define another feed, by wrapping Redis connection
# in a ConnectionPool
SimpleFeed.define(:notifications) do |f|
  f.provider = SimpleFeed::Providers::Redis::Provider.new(
    redis: -> { ::Redis.new(host: '192.168.10.10', port: 9000) },
    pool_size: 10
  )
  f.per_page = 50
end
```

After the feed is defined, the gem creates a similarly named method
under the `SimpleFeed` namespace to access the feed. For example, given
a name such as `:news_feed` the following are all valid ways of
accessing the feed:

 * `SimpleFeed.news_feed`
 * `SimpleFeed.get(:news_feed)`

You can also get a full list of currently defined feeds with `SimpleFeed.feed_names` method.

### Two Versions of the Feed API

The API is offered in two approaches:

1. Single-user API is accessed via the `SimpleFeed::Feed#user_activity` instance method.
   Optimized for simplicity of data retrieval of a single-user,
   this method allows performing multiple queries about the same
   user in an optimized fashion sometimes avoiding unnecessary requests.

2. Multi-user API is accessed via methods on the `SimpleFeed::Feed` instance.
   This API is recommended when dealing with updates of activity feed belonging to many users at
   the same time.
    * The Redis Provider, for example, uses `pipelining` to send updates
      for different users asynchronously and concurrently.
    * Multi-user operations return a `SimpleFeed::Response` object,
      which can be used as a hash (keyed on user_id) to fetch the result
      of a given user.


### Publishing Data to the Feed

#### Single User

Once we have an instance of the `UserActivity` class, we can use one of
the public methods to read and write into the feed:

```ruby
# Using the Feed API:
SimpleFeed.get(:followers).store(user_ids: [1,2,3...], value: 'hello', at: Time.now)

# Using UserActivity API:
user_activity = SimpleFeed.get(:followers).user_activity(current_user.id)
user_activity.store(value: '{ "comment_id": 100, "author_id": 932424 }', at: Time.now)
user_activity.store(value: 'Jon liked Christen\'s post', at: Time.now)
```
In the above example, we stored two separate events, one was stored as a `JSON` string, and the other as a human readable upate.

How exactly you serialize your events is up to you, but a higher-level
abstraction gem `activity-feed` decorates this library with additional
compact serialization schemes for ruby and Rails applications.

#### Multiple Users

```ruby
# Using the Feed API:
@user_ids = [1,2,4]
@users_activities = SimpleFeed.get(:followers).for(@user_ids)

@users_activities.store(value: 'hello', at: Time.now)
# => [Response] { user_id => [Boolean], ... } true if the value was stored, false if it wasn't.
```

### Reading the Feed

#### Single User

```ruby
require 'simplefeed'

user_activity.total_count
#=> 412
user_activity.unread_count
#=> 12
user_activity.paginate(page: 1)
# => [
# <SimpleFeed::Event#0x2134afa value='Jon followed Igbis' at='2016-11-20 23:32:56 -0800'>,
# <SimpleFeed::Event#0xf98f234 value='George liked Jons post' at='2016-12-10 21:32:56 -0800'>
# ....
# ]
# now, let's force-reset the last read timestamp
user_activity.reset_last_read # defaults to Time.now
#=> 0
user_activity.unread_count
#=> 0
```

## Complete API

### Single User

For a single user, via the `UserActivity` convenience class:

```ruby
require 'simplefeed'

@ua = SimpleFeed.get(:news).user_activity(current_user.id)

@ua.store(value:, at:)
# => [Boolean] true if the value was stored, false if it wasn't.

@ua.remove(value:, at:)
# => [Boolean] true if the value was removed, false if it didn't exist

@ua.wipe
# => [Boolean] true

@ua.paginate(page:, per_page:, peek: false)
# => [Array]<Event>
# with peak: true does not reset last_read

@ua.all
# => [Array]<Event>

@ua.reset_last_read
# => [Time] last_read

@ua.total_count
# => [Integer] total_count

@ua.unread_count
# => [Integer] unread_count

@ua.last_read
# => [Time] last_read
```

#### Batch User API

Each API call at this level expects an array of user IDs, therefore the
return value is an object, `SimpleFeed::Response`, containing individual
responses for each user, accessible via `response[user_id]` method.

```ruby
@multi = SimpleFeed.get(:feed_name).for(User.active.map(&:id))

@multi.store(value:, at:)
@multi.store(event:)
# => [Response] { user_id => [Boolean], ... } true if the value was stored, false if it wasn't.

@multi.remove(value:, at:)
@multi.remove(event:)
# => [Response] { user_id => [Boolean], ... } true if the value was removed, false if it didn't exist

@multi.wipe
# => [Response] { user_id => [Boolean], ... } true if user activity was found and deleted, false otherwise

@multi.paginate(page:, per_page:, peek: false)
# => [Response] { user_id => [Array]<Event>, ... }
# With (peak: true) does not reset last_read, otherwise it does.

@multi.all
# => [Response] { user_id => [Array]<Event>, ... }

@multi.reset_last_read
# => [Response] { user_id => [Time] last_read, ... }

@multi.total_count
# => [Response] { user_id => [Integer] total_count, ... }

@multi.unread_count
# => [Response] { user_id => [Integer] unread_count, ... }

@multi.last_read
# => [Response] { user_id => [Time] last_read, ... }

```

## Providers

A provider is an underlying implementation that persists the events for each user, together with some meta-data for each feed.

It is the intention of this gem that:

 * it should be easy to swap providers
 * it should be easy to add new providers

Each provider must implement exactly the public API of a provider shown
above (the `Feed` version, that receives `user_ids:` as arguments).

Two providers are available with this gem:

 * `SimpleFeed::Providers::Redis::Provider` is the production-ready provider that uses ZSET operations to store events as a sorted set in Redis
* `SimpleFeed::Providers::HashProvider` is the pure Hash implementation
  of a provider that can be useful in unit tests of the host
  application. This provider may be used to push events within a single
  ruby process, but can be serialized to a YAML file in order to be
  restored later in another process.
